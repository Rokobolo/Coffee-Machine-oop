# Coffee-Machine-oop
This is an OOP version of the coffee machine published earlier this month.

## In short
- I forgot to commit this readme once and have to rewrite it all again.

## What does it do?
- The same than the previous version, except that it won't detect wrong input.
- So technically it does less...

## Why this version?
- This version is part of my day 16 of programming course and is meant for me to learn about the difference between procedural and object oriented programming.

## Notes
- It is important to note that only the main.py was written by myself, the rest of the files and code were provided by the teacher.
